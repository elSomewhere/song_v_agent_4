“### **Drawing Style Description:**

**Type:**  
Digital illustration with a *hand-drawn, graphic novel/anime hybrid aesthetic*.

**Color Palette:**  
- Muted, desaturated tones—mainly cold blues, greys, and dark neutrals.  
- Slight grunge texture overlay gives it a worn, analog look.
- Subtle lighting with soft glows from panels or screens; low overall brightness, contributing to a somber and moody atmosphere.

**Linework:**  
- Heavy, bold outlines with slight texture—almost inked by hand.
- Crosshatching and shading textures for detail and depth (especially on armor and face).
- Clearly defined facial features and shadows, emphasizing emotional intensity.

**Character Design:**  
- Realistic proportions but stylized faces (inspired by anime or serious manga).
- Armor design is utilitarian and grounded, not exaggerated—evokes sci-fi realism.
- Hair and expression are sharply rendered; the character's demeanor is stoic and focused.

**Environment:**  
- Narrow, dimly lit sci-fi interior (like a spaceship or military base).
- Strong use of perspective and symmetry, especially in background architecture.

**Overall Mood:**  
- Cinematic and gritty, like a frame from a serious space opera or mature anime.  
- Evokes themes of isolation, duty, or inner strength.
